# Full Moon 2: The Season of Penance

Requires [Egg](https://github.com/aksommerville/egg) to build.

This is a sequel to my 2023 game [Full Moon](https://github.com/aksommerville/fullmoon4).

For [GDEX Game Jam 2024](https://itch.io/jam/gdex-game-jam-2024), theme "FULL MOON".

## TODO

- [ ] Open Itch page to public. Currently password "dot-in-a-habit"
- [ ] Shorten Take Wing, and the end sequence. The final walk in particular just drags on.
- - Currently 52 s to the end of credits text (we reach the final slide a few seconds ahead of that, and music ends a few seconds after)
- - For comparison, the intro is 37 s (all but the first stage).
- - I guess 30..40 s is the target?
- [ ] Music.
- - [ ] Review instruments again, after I've heard them all a few times.
- - [ ] '' sound effects.
- [ ] The lock puzzle feels wrong. Bad sound effects, and I'm not sure, the moment of unlocking, it just doesn't pop.
- [ ] Build for Pi. Include linux-x86 and raspi binaries on Itch.
- [ ] Make nice mp3s of all the music and share those too.
- [x] Top Bonus Zone: Simon Says. Watch a bear put on masks, and transform into whatever he's dressed as.
