# Full Moon 2: The Season of Penance

Requires [Egg](https://github.com/aksommerville/egg) to build.

This is a sequel to my 2023 game [Full Moon](https://github.com/aksommerville/fullmoon4).

For [GDEX Game Jam 2024](https://itch.io/jam/gdex-game-jam-2024), theme "FULL MOON".

## TODO

- [ ] Open Itch page to public. Currently password "dot-in-a-habit"
- [ ] Hello: Roll in credits after a delay?
- [ ] Static map animation, eg ripples on water.
- [x] Visual transitions.
- [ ] Music.
- - [ ] Review instruments again, after I've heard them all a few times.
- - [ ] '' sound effects.
- [x] fleshpuppet should take damage while ghost. There's very few places where damage is possible, I don't think this matters.
- [ ] The lock puzzle feels wrong. Bad sound effects, and I'm not sure, the moment of unlocking, it just doesn't pop.
- [ ] Build for Pi. Include linux-x86 and raspi binaries on Itch.
- [ ] Make nice mp3s of all the music and share those too.
