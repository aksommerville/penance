# Full Moon 2: The Season of Penance

Requires [Egg](https://github.com/aksommerville/egg) to build.

This is a sequel to my 2023 game [Full Moon](https://github.com/aksommerville/fullmoon4).

For [GDEX Game Jam 2024](https://itch.io/jam/gdex-game-jam-2024), theme "FULL MOON".

## TODO

Required:
- [ ] Sound effects.
- [ ] Fireworks when transforming to/from animal.
- [ ] Crow. Or maybe drop it. Is there any need for a crow's assistance? ...have somebody play at the review session Wednesday
- [x] Needs an extra click to start on Itch, what gives? ...trivially reproducible, just iframe the main html.
- - ...but now it's not happening anymore on itch. Whatever. Added a "click you have to" message to the description.
- [ ] Pics and such for Itch page.
- [ ] Open Itch page to public. Currently password "dot-in-a-habit"

Stretch goals or uncertain:
- [ ] Hello: Roll in credits after a delay?
- [ ] Static map animation, eg ripples on water.
- [ ] Visual transitions.
- [ ] Music.
- - [ ] Drums for Doors Without Walls.
- - [ ] Review instruments again, after I've heard them all a few times.
- [x] Jammio cameo
- [ ] fleshpuppet should take damage while ghost. There's very few places where damage is possible, I don't think this matters.

## Recommended Course

- crow. Should be the first thing you learn, otherwise who can you ask.
- fireball. Must be before candles. Put a positioned spell first.
- open. Good to be early, so you can enter the temple and see your progress.
- candle1 WEST
- rabbit
- turtle
- candle2
- teleport. Teach wherever candle2 is. The part leading to candle3 is not accessible on foot.
- bird
- ghost
- flower
- candle3
- Temple: Wrap-up
