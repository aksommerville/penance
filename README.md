# Full Moon 2: The Season of Penance

Requires [Egg](https://github.com/aksommerville/egg) to build.

This is a sequel to my 2023 game [Full Moon](https://github.com/aksommerville/fullmoon4).

For [GDEX Game Jam 2024](https://itch.io/jam/gdex-game-jam-2024), theme "FULL MOON".

## TODO

Required:
- [x] Sound effects.
- [x] Sound effect in web. All screwed up compared to native.
- [x] Fireworks when transforming to/from animal. ...only "from". Stepping out of the hole is good, doesn't need accentuation.
- [x] Crow. Or maybe drop it. Is there any need for a crow's assistance? ...have somebody play at the review session Wednesday. Drop it.
- [ ] Open Itch page to public. Currently password "dot-in-a-habit"

Stretch goals or uncertain:
- [ ] Make the three cluestones more distinctive.
- [x] Change the finale to night with a big full moon.
- [ ] Hello: Roll in credits after a delay?
- [ ] Static map animation, eg ripples on water.
- [ ] Visual transitions.
- [ ] Music.
- - [ ] Drums for Doors Without Walls.
- - [ ] Review instruments again, after I've heard them all a few times.
- - [ ] '' sound effects.
- [ ] fleshpuppet should take damage while ghost. There's very few places where damage is possible, I don't think this matters.
- [x] Bonfires react to wind.
- [ ] Tone down the lake just south of the fireball cluestone. Or put a secret there. Looks like a secret.
- [x] Can we lead them into the tree stump harder at first? ...yes: Put the stump out in the middle of the clearing.
- [ ] Vertical fireball? Or just "nyrrrgh" when they go UUUU or DDDD.

## Recommended Course

- turtle
- candle2
- teleport. Teach wherever candle2 is. The part leading to candle3 is not accessible on foot.
- bird
- ghost
