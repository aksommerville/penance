# Full Moon 2: The Season of Penance

Requires [Egg](https://github.com/aksommerville/egg) to build.

This is a sequel to my 2023 game [Full Moon](https://github.com/aksommerville/fullmoon4).

For [GDEX Game Jam 2024](https://itch.io/jam/gdex-game-jam-2024), theme "FULL MOON".

## TODO

Week:
- [x] Candles to light.
- [ ] Sound effects.
- [ ] Allow hazard sprites to indicate explicit rejection direction.
- [ ] Fireworks when transforming to/from animal.
- [ ] Challenges:
- - [ ] Wind that toggles on and off, so you have to turn into a flower when it's on.
- - [ ] Aiming cannon. Turn into a ghost and make it aim at a switch.

- - [ ] Locked door, but not the one on the temple.

Stretch goals or uncertain:
