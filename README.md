# Full Moon 2: The Season of Penance

Requires [Egg](https://github.com/aksommerville/egg) to build.

This is a sequel to my 2023 game [Full Moon](https://github.com/aksommerville/fullmoon4).

For [GDEX Game Jam 2024](https://itch.io/jam/gdex-game-jam-2024), theme "FULL MOON".

## TODO

Week:
- [x] Candles to light.
- [ ] Editing map commands is broken, they aren't saving.
- [ ] Don't put anything burnable on the borders.
- [ ] Sound effects.
- [ ] Allow hazard sprites to indicate explicit rejection direction.
- [ ] Fireworks when transforming to/from animal.
- [ ] Challenges:
- - [ ] Wind that toggles on and off, so you have to turn into a flower when it's on.
- - [ ] Bullet hell that only a turtle can get thru alive.
- - [ ] Multiple switches that you can't get between them fast enough, unless you're a rabbit. Introduce the switches first with an easier challenge.

Saturday:
- [ ] Monsters.
- [ ] Goals.
- [ ] Crow. Have the whole flow finished first.

Final Sunday:
- [ ] Finale.
- [ ] Hello: Roll in credits after a delay?
- [ ] Pics and such for Itch page.
- [ ] Open Itch page to public. Currently password "dot-in-a-habit"

Stretch goals or uncertain:
- [ ] Static map animation, eg ripples on water.
- [ ] Solid sprites: Try not to need this, can we do without?
- [ ] Visual transitions.
- [ ] Music.
- - [ ] Drums for Doors Without Walls.
- - [ ] Review instruments again, after I've heard them all a few times.
- [ ] Jammio cameo
- [ ] Needs an extra click to start on Itch, what gives?

- [ ] fleshpuppet should take damage while ghost

## Recommended Course

- crow. Should be the first thing you learn, otherwise who can you ask.
- fireball. Must be before candles. Put a positioned spell first.
- open. Good to be early, so you can enter the temple and see your progress.
- candle1 WEST
- rabbit
- turtle
- candle2
- teleport. Teach wherever candle2 is. The part leading to candle3 is not accessible on foot.
- bird
- ghost
- flower
- candle3
- Temple: Wrap-up
